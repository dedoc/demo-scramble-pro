## About Cally

Cally is a simple demo application for Scramble PRO. This is a REST API for simple ATS (applications tracking system) software.

When browsing the codebase, notice how there are no redundant PHPDoc annotations contrary to other API documentation generation tools for Laravel. 

## Authentication

This API uses Laravel Sanctum. So you can check `ApiDocumentationProvider` to see the security setup that corresponds to the Laravel Sanctum API.
