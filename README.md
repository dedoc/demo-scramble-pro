## About Cally

Cally is a simple demo application for Scramble PRO. This is a REST API for simple ATS (applications tracking system) software.

When browsing the codebase, notice how there are no redundant PHPDoc annotations contrary to other API documentation generation tools for Laravel. 

Cally's source: https://github.com/dedoc/demo-scramble-pro

For every documented endpoint you'll find the link to the source file on GitHub in the endpoint's description. This is done, so you can quickly find and see the source code for any endpoint.

## Authentication

This API uses Laravel Sanctum. So you can check `ApiDocumentationProvider` to see the security setup that corresponds to the Laravel Sanctum API.
