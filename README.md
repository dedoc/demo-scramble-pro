## About Cally

Cally is a simple demo application for Scramble PRO. This is a REST API for simple ATS (applications tracking system) software.

When browsing the codebase, notice how there are no redundant PHPDoc annotations contrary to other API documentation generation tools for Laravel. 

Cally's source: https://github.com/dedoc/demo-scramble-pro

For every documented endpoint and schema you'll find the link to the file on GitHub in the description, so you can quickly check the source.

## Authentication

This API uses Laravel Sanctum. So you can check `ApiDocumentationProvider` to see the security setup that corresponds to the Laravel Sanctum API.
